# Coins
How do you choose the coins in your pocket to pay something? 
There is an algorithm to use the max numbers of coins?
Of course there is as shown in the book "L'algoritmo del parcheggio" (the
parking algorithm) by Prof. Furio Honsell.
This GUI help you to choose the exact combination of coins that you have 
in your pocket to pay the bill.

Syntax: coins

Example: Supposing you have in your pocket 6 coins of 1 eurocents, 5 coins of 2
eurocents, 9 coins of 5 eurocents, 5 coins of 10 eurocents, 2 coins of 20
eurocents and 2 coins of 1 euro and you must pay 0.85 euro for the coffee
